# AgricultureRobotics
The repository for the TU/e project agriculture robotics in collaboration with VeXtronics.

## Rules
- Make a new branch for every subsystem (pathplanning, computervision, simulation)
- When implementing a new feature create a new branch in your subbranch (computervision/yolo)
- Commit often not only when you want to push your code
- When merging asks others to review the code
